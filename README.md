How do I approach designing software?
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
What design process did you follow for your project work?
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
#Approaching designing software has changed in the sense that I now understand how to create simple shapes within OpenGL. I worked step by step from the top, taking a look at the requests of the client(in this case the module) to ensure they are all applied. This can be used within all aspects of coding.

How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
How did iteration factor into your development?
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
#As I was new to OpenGL and 2d/3d coding, the strategies I used was to thoroughly go through the tutorial then go step by step on the instructions to implement the code from the instructions. 

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
#Both educationally and professionally, I learned alot within this course and it has really opened some doors for the future for me. I have always been fond of Video Games and it was really cool to implement and create objects similarly to how they would be creating in a video game.
